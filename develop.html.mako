<a name="developers"></a>
<h2>Development Community</h2>

<p>Where can you find the Developers of SQLAlchemy ?</p>

<p>
    <em>The Developers of SQLAlchemy kindly request all people participating in 
    these channels respect the <a href="/codeofconduct.html">Code of Conduct</a> when 
    seeking or providing support.</em>
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Mailing Lists</li>
    <ul>
        <li>The <a href="/support.html#mailinglist">main mailing list</a> is the most 
            common - core devs assist users with issues of all kinds. All SQLAlchemy 
            Users and Third-Party Library authors are encouraged to participate here
            and seek support of any kind.
        </li>
        <li>A secondary <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/sqlalchemy-devel">
            development mailing list</a>, also hosted on Google groups, is dedicated
            to Developer concerns such as: release announcements, architectural and 
            developmental issues, and issues pertaining to Third-Party Library authors.
            This list is typically low traffic; all posts intended for this channel are
            welcome on the <a href="/support.html#mailinglist">main mailing list</a> .
        </li>
    </ul>
    <li>Real-Time Communication</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Development discussion continually occurs in the 
            <a href="https://gitter.im/sqlalchemy/devel">sqlalchemy/devel</a> Gitter room
            througout the week. Discussion in this room is intended for users 
            who are interested in contributing code, tests, documentation, or other 
            developmental resources. This channel is the current preferred real-time
            discussion medium for SQLAlchemy contributors and hosts the 
            <a href="#scheduled-developer-meetings">Scheduled Developer Meetings</a>.
            Gitter based support is available via the
            <a href="https://gitter.im/sqlalchemy/community">sqlalchemy/community</a> Gitter
            room; more information on this is available on the 
            <a href="/support.html#gitter">support</a> page.
        </li>
        <li>There is a legacy <code>#sqlalchemy-devel</code> IRC channel on Freenode.
            This channel is <strong>only</strong> for users that are interested in
            contributing code, tests, documentation, or other developmental resources.
            <strong>No support issues will be addressed here.</strong>
            IRC-based support is available on the <a href="/support.html#irc">main 
            IRC channel</a>.
            This channel is considered to be a legacy format; users are encouraged to
            use the Gitter room.
        </li>
    </ul>
</ul>



<a name="scheduled-developer-meetings"></a>
<h3>Scheduled Developer Meetings</h3>

<p>A real-time virtual meeting of core developers and contributers occurs in the
   <a href="https://gitter.im/sqlalchemy/devel">sqlalchemy/devel</a> Gitter room
   on a regular basis. This meeting is intended to be held weekly at a regular time,
   but this may vary based on the availability of required members.  In advance of 
   every meeting, the room will contain a link to a document containing the Date, 
   Time and Agenda for the next scheduled meeting; currently this appears in the 
   "Subject Line" or "Title"  of the room. These meetings and their records are 
   open to the public. Users who are interested in contributing code, tests, 
   documentation, or other developmental resources are encouraged to attend.
</p>


<a name="source"></a>
<h2>Source Access</h2>
<p>
    SQLAlchemy's source code is versioned using <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a>.
    The primary public repository is at <b>GitHub</b>:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>GitHub:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/">https://github.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/</a>
        <p>
            <br/>
            <code>
                git clone https://github.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy.git
            </code>
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>


<a name="pullrequests"></a>
<h2>Pull Requests</h2>

<p>
    Pull requests are submitted to the GitHub repository at <a href="https://github
    .com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy">https://github.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy</a>. Once
    accepted for review, assuming the pull request is altering the code itself and
    not just correcting documentation issues, code review occurs within our Gerrit
    system at <a
    href="https://gerrit.sqlalchemy.org">https://gerrit.sqlalchemy.org</a> where we
    can review, modify, and run it through continuous integration tests with a high
    degree of control and collaborative ability. The pull request will be closed
    with a link to the review in Gerrit. Pull requests for code changes are never
    merged directly.
</p>

<p>
    Please note the <b>Guidelines for Pull Requests</b> which modify
    source code (e.g. not just documentation):
</p>

<ul>
    <li><a name="pr-requires-issue"></a>
        <b>Issues for Pull Requests:
        <em>It is required to submit an issue in the issue tracker before submitting a pull request.</em>
        </b>
        It is a frequent occurence that pull requests submitted either don't describe
        what problem they intend to solve, or they solve the problem in an inappropriate
        or sub-optimal way.   Having a bug or feature issue opened ahead of time
        will allow us to to understand the use case and discuss the best approach
        before the contributor makes the effort to write the code and tests.
        The issue number used by Github is also linked in the changelog and is used to 
        generate a changelog file entry for merge.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a name="pr-requires-tests"></a>
        <b>Always include tests with the change in code</b> - SQLAlchemy does not
        commit changes to code without a corresponding test - every line of code that
        isn't tested is technically a bug in itself.  When a pull request is submitted
        without tests, it <b>cannot be merged</b> until a test is written.  It is
        extremely common that we receive a pull request that is one line long,
        yet we need to write many dozens of lines to test it, since <b>99% of the work
        for any code change is writing the tests</b>.  <b>Please don't submit
        one-liner PRs without tests.  Only submit a <a href="participate.html#bugs">complete
        bug report</a> for code changes where you aren't able to provide tests</b>.
    </li>
    <li><b>Please follow up for "requests for changes" on your pull request, as well
        as subscribe to the Gerrit review to receive comments.</b> - Pull requests where
        requested changes are not responded towards will be closed.
    </li>
    <li>Please make sure you are configured to run the current <a href="#environment">Development Environment</a>
        requirements, which will help ensure your PRs pass automatic tests.
    </li>
    <li>Instead of editing the Changelog file itself, please adopt the following workflow:
        <ul>
            <li>If the PR does not already have a corresponding issue in GitHub,
                please create a new issue in GitHub.
                (See <a href="#pr-requires-issue">Issues for Pull Requests</a>)
            </li>
            <li>Create a per-issue changelog file with the path
                `/doc/build/changelog/unreleased_{Version}/{IssueId}.rst`, in which
                `IssueId` is the auto-generated GitHub Issue Id.
            </li>
            <li>The format for a changelog file uses the `.rst` markup described at 
                <a href="https://github.com/sqlalchemyorg/changelog">sqlalchemyorg/changelog</a>. 
                See the file `/doc/build/changelog/README.txt` in SQLAlchemy's 
                source code for more details and an example. 
                Please note: SqlAclhemy's documentation uses a custom Sphinx 
                extension that introduces new directives to reStructuredText files.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>


<a name="testing"></a>
<h2>Testing</h2>

<p>
    A critical task for anyone wishing to develop even small features or fixes is
    to be proficient in running the tests,     and in the ideal case, being able to
    write tests.  SQLAlchemy has over many thousands of tests which span in focus
    from unit to integration, and a full continuous integration run over multiple
    Python  versions and database backends runs well over <b>two hundred thousand
    individual tests</b>.

    By far the largest scope of development work, both on the
    existing codebase as well as when any new feature or fix is     being
    implemented, is in writing complete tests.   The tests for a particular change
    or feature are generally     five to ten times as many lines of code as the
    code for the actual behavior.  They also can be much more difficult to
    write than the actual feature, often requiring a wide variety of difficult-to-
    anticipate variants on the target behavior,     injection of behavior for
    testing purposes, interception of generated SQL, events, or elements of DBAPI
    messaging.
</p>

<p>
    Tests are run using <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest">py.test</a>.
    A comprehensive guide to running the tests is     present in the     file
    <a href="${self.attr.bb_base}/blob/master/README.unittests.rst">README.unittests</a>,
    which is present in the source distribution. This file explains in detail how
    tests can be run across many scopes, including how to run for specific databases
    and how to select for specific tests.
</p>

<p>
    The tests themselves have been written over the course of many years, and stylistically have evolved.   We try
    to upgrade old tests to newer styles as we become more proficient and advanced in our methodologies,
    but there are still many tests that are in need of an upgrade.   Our current preferred style, keeping in mind
    that many of our tests are certainly not yet in this style, is as follows:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Tests should stick to <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/">PEP8</a>.
        Many older tests currently do not; this is an area
        in which we welcome new help.
    </li>
    <li>
        Test just one thing.   A series of individual assertions are best broken up into individual
        test methods, rather than one test method with several assertions.
    </li>
    <li>Maintain per-test state as local to a test fixture.   That is, if a series of tests are all
        against a specific table structure, the test fixture should prepare the table metadata and
        associate it with <code>self</code> or <code>cls</code>.   The test suite has standard fixtures which
        help greatly with this process, under <code>test/lib/fixtures.py</code>.
    </li>
    <li>Don't test against a database backend if not needed.   Many kinds of tests only need
        to ensure that a particular SQL string is rendered.   We have a comprehensive set of
        fixtures which allow SQL strings to be captured and asserted without any database round
        trip needed.
    </li>
</ul>

<a name="integration"></a>
<h2>Continuous Integration</h2>

The SQLAlchemy project uses Jenkins for continuous integration.   Our read-only
Jenkins interface is available at <a href="https://jenkins.sqlalchemy.org">https://jenkins.sqlalchemy.org</a>.

<a name="documentation"></a>
<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>Documentation builds using <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Sphinx/">Sphinx</a>.
    New developers can be very helpful if they are willing
    to write new documentation, or to work on current documentation, adding new examples,
    fixing typos, improving inter-documentation
    linkage.   This is also some of the most important and difficult work for the project.
    As is the case with
    testing, good documentation takes up a significantly larger amount of time to
    create than the feature itself being documented.  It's not as fun to write documentation
    for most developers as it is to write actual code, but a developer who is willing and
    able to do so is tremendously valuable to the project.
</p>

<a name="style"></a>
<h2>Code Guidelines</h2>

<p>We hope to expand this section.   For now, some key things to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Try to stick to <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/">PEP8</a> as much as possible.
        Our line width is 78 characters and we tend to break lines on backslashes rather than parenthesis;
        in particular SQLAlchemy generative queries are most easy to read broken up along backslashes.
    </li>
    <li>New features can only be added if they have associated documentation that
        runs under <a href="#documentation">Sphinx.</a>
    </li>
    <li>No feature or bug fix is ever committed without full <a href="#testing">unit tests</a>
        to as much a degree as possible.
    </li>
    <li>Please make sure you are configured to run the current <a href="#environment">Development Environment</a>
        requirements, which will help ensure your PRs pass automatic tests.
    </li>
</ul>


<a name="environment"></a>
<h2>Development Environment</h2>

<p>
    The SQLAlchemy project has recently standardized to adopting a few conventions during development,
    most of which can be automatically enforced by a properly configured development environment.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Source code formatting and other utilities are automatically applied using hooks in the <a href="https://pre-commit.com ">pre-commit</a> framework.
        `pre-commit` can be installed by running <code>pip install pre-commit</code>.
    </li>
    <li>Source code is formatted using Python Software Foundation's <a href="https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">black</a>.
        `black` can be installed by running <code>pip install black</code>,
        however `pre-commit` should automatically install it in most situations.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    TLDR; please ensure <a href="https://pre-commit.com ">pre-commit</a> is installed in your environment before beginning work on a Pull Request.
</p>


<a name="sprints"></a>
<h2>Sprints</h2>
<p>
    The SQLAlchemy project has an interest in attracting developers through sprints.   Currently,
    there are only occasional sprints typically annually at Pycon US, though not always.
    We are in need of assistance with planning, organizing and running sprints
    such that new developers are well prepared to contribute and learn about SQLAlchemy.
    Contributors who are interested in mentoring new developers at sprints or hosting other sprints during
    the year are encouraged to contact the developers, we would love to have more assistance in this area.
</p>
